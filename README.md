### Suggestions
* It is suggested analyzing data for bike usage over the months.

* New York City has bike lanes, it is suggested that the Des Moines streets are assessed on if they are bike-friendly or not.

* It is important to take into account that New York City is relatively compact. The average distance of Des Moines workers to their job may be larger than that of New York City which may affect bike usage.
